## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context
A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

## Key Concepts for WorkOut Tracker
* NoSQL
* MongoDB
* Object-document mapping
* Mongoose.js
* CRUD

## Build Process 
There is 5 step process in creating the WorkOut App. 
1. Analysis the provide files from Bootcamp Repository and run the seeds
2. Create the HTML routes and design the models
3. Design the API routes
4. Test and fix up the CSS
5. Upload to Heroku

## Project Issues
App currently only logs new or continued exercise routines. Currently implemented handlebars and experimented with a larger database but due to time restraints could not create a more robust system which takes in a username and offers additional customization.

Couldn't help but update some of the CSS with tailwindCSS (small update)

Key issues
1. Need a log in page that displays previous users and a form for new years
2. Database needs to be updated to include weight, age, startDate and extras
3. Additional exercises or customization templates need to be included
4. General better CSS and layout
